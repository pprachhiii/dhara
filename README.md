- Each Drive has:

  - Linked reports.
  - Proposed date/time.
  - Suggested task breakdown.

- **Discussion happens at the Drive Voting Hub level**:

  - Monitoring for \~1 month.

# **Where Discussions Happen (Centralized)**

1. **Report Voting Hub** ‚Üí one discussion thread for prioritization (not per report).
